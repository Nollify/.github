# GitHub Actions Workflows for Nollify ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Nollify** GitHub Actions Workflows! ðŸŽ‰

Here, we automate many repetitive tasks to ensure a smooth experience for contributors and maintainers. Our current workflows include:

- **Auto Assign Label**: Automatically assigns labels to discussions/issues based on predefined rules.
- **Auto Tagging**: Automatically tags issues and discussions based on keywords.
- **Discussion Inactivity**: Automatically closes discussions that have been inactive for too long.
- **Profanity Filter**: Filters out and flags any discussions or issues with inappropriate language.
- **Welcome New Contributor**: Sends a welcome message and provides helpful links to new contributors when they open their first issue or discussion.

We continuously improve these workflows to better serve our community. If you notice anything that could be improved or would like to suggest a new automation, feel free to open a discussion or issue! ðŸ™Œ

Thanks for contributing to Nollify and helping us make the best open-source music platform! ðŸ’–
